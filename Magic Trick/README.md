#  Udacity AR Nanodegree Project
This is a demo app showing ARKit's capabilities by allowing the user to throw balls into a hat and make
the balls within the hat disappear.

**Instructions to Use**

This project can be built and run on a target device with Xcode Version 9.0 and Swift 3.

To run this project, open it in XCode, build and run on a device that supports ARKIT.

**Using the App**
This app simulates the user throwing balls into a hat in augmented reality.

1. First, look around the floor until ARKit detects a horizontal plane.  When a horizontal plane is detected, a hat will automatically be placed on the floor where a plane is detected.
2. Touching any part of the screen or the "Throw Ball" button will throw a ball in the direction the camera is facing. Try to get some of the balls within the hat.
3. Once balls are within the hat, pressing the "Magic Trick" button will cause all balls within the hat to disappear.  Pressing the magic button again will cause the balls to reappear.
